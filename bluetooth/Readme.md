# üîãüéß Bluetooth Headset Battery Level

This is a python script to fetch the battery charge level of some Bluetooth headsets.

You need python 3.6 or newer to run the script.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run

### There are two options:

#### 1. Install from PyPI
Please ensure you have the BlueZ and python libraries and header files if you are using Ubuntu/Debian based distros:
```bash
sudo apt install libbluetooth-dev python3-dev
```

Then, install with pip:
```bash
pip3 install bluetooth_battery

bluetooth_battery BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
```
_the dependency `pybluez` should be installed automatically, but if not, you may need to install it manually_

#### 2. Download this repository
```bash
chmod +x bluetooth_battery.py

./bluetooth_battery.py BT_MAC_ADDRESS_1 ...
```

_make sure you have `python-pybluez` or `python3-pybluez` or `python3-bluez` installed on your system._

**You can input addresses for as many devices as you want separated by space.**



### It didn't work?

You can set the port number manually by adding a dot at the end of mac address, like this: `00:00:00:00:00:00.3`

Try port numbers `1 to 30` to find the one that works for your device. (wait a few seconds between each try)

If that didn't work, disconnect your device first, and then try again.

### Still doesn't work?

Please consider that this script doesn't guarantee to support every bluetooth device.

You can open a new issue for discussion or check the existing ones for more information.
